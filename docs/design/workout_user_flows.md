# Feature Design: Complete Workout User Flows

## Overview
Implementation of 5 comprehensive user flows for workout management following progressive disclosure principles and TDD methodology.

## Feature Requirements

### 1. Starting a Workout Flow

- FR-1.4: Modal displays all exercises with sets Ã— reps, equipment, and muscle groups
- FR-1.5: "START WORKOUT" button creates active session and redirects
- FR-1.6: Modal can be cancelled without side effects

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- NFR-1.1: Dashboard loads in <2 seconds
- NFR-1.2: Modal opens instantly with optimistic UI
- NFR-1.3: Session creation completes in <1 second

### 2. During Workout Flow (Primary Path)
**Goal**: Provide flexible navigation during active workouts

**Functional Requirements**:
- FR-2.1: Display exercise list with visual state indicators (current/completed/upcoming)
- FR-2.2: Current exercise highlighted with orange styling
- FR-2.3: Completed exercises show green with 75% opacity
- FR-2.4: Upcoming exercises show gray with 50% opacity
- FR-2.5: Option A - Normal progression with set completion and rest timer
- FR-2.6: Option B - Skip remaining sets in current exercise
- FR-2.7: Option C - Direct jump to any exercise by clicking sidebar
- FR-2.8: Auto-advance set counter after completion
- FR-2.9: Rest timer with configurable duration per exercise
- FR-2.10: Auto-advance to next exercise after completing all sets

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- NFR-2.1: State changes reflect immediately (optimistic updates)
- NFR-2.2: Exercise navigation completes in <200ms
- NFR-2.3: Timer accuracy within 1 second deviation

### 3. Weight Tracking Flow
**Goal**: Optional weight tracking based on exercise equipment

**Functional Requirements**:
- FR-3.1: Barbell/dumbbell exercises show weight input by default
- FR-3.2: Bodyweight exercises hide weight input initially
- FR-3.3: "Add weight tracking" link for bodyweight exercises
- FR-3.4: Weight input is always optional (can be left blank)
- FR-3.5: Previous weight shown as placeholder for consistency
- FR-3.6: Reps input always visible with target reps as placeholder

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- NFR-3.1: Weight/reps data persists immediately on input
- NFR-3.2: Input validation prevents negative values
- NFR-3.3: Decimal precision to 2 places for weight

### 4. Workout Completion Flow
**Goal**: Always accessible completion and cancellation options

**Functional Requirements**:
- FR-4.1: "FINISH" button always visible in sticky header
- FR-4.2: "PAUSE/PLAY" toggle always visible in sticky header
- FR-4.3: "Cancel" (X) button always visible in sticky header
- FR-4.4: FINISH saves all set performances and creates completion record
- FR-4.5: FINISH redirects to Progress page with immediate history update
- FR-4.6: Cancel shows confirmation dialog
- FR-4.7: Cancel confirmed discards all progress and returns to Dashboard
- FR-4.8: Pause stops timer and allows session resumption
- FR-4.9: Timer tracks total pause duration separately

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- NFR-4.1: Sticky header remains visible during all scroll positions
- NFR-4.2: Completion save completes in <2 seconds
- NFR-4.3: Pause/resume state persists across page refreshes

### 5. Post-Workout Management Flow
**Goal**: Comprehensive workout history management

**Functional Requirements**:
- FR-5.1: Progress page displays workout history in chronological order
- FR-5.2: Each workout shows: name, date, duration, sets, weight total, rating
- FR-5.3: Edit functionality for duration, rating (1-5 stars), and notes
- FR-5.4: Delete functionality with confirmation dialog
- FR-5.5: Real-time stats calculation (streaks, totals, averages)
- FR-5.6: Edit changes save immediately without page refresh
- FR-5.7: Delete removes workout and updates stats instantly

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- NFR-5.1: History loads in <3 seconds for 100 workouts
- NFR-5.2: Edit/delete operations complete in <1 second
- NFR-5.3: Stats calculations update in real-time

## Design Principles

### Progressive Disclosure
1. **Default Simple**: Show only essential information initially
2. **Reveal on Demand**: Advanced features available when needed
3. **Contextual Controls**: Right actions at the right time
4. **Minimal Cognitive Load**: Reduce decision paralysis

### Flexibility Without Complexity
1. **Multiple Paths**: Linear progression + skip options + direct navigation
2. **Optional Features**: Weight tracking only when needed
3. **Forgiving Interface**: Allow editing after completion
4. **Escape Hatches**: Always provide way out

### Immediate Feedback
1. **Optimistic Updates**: UI responds before server confirmation
2. **Visual State**: Clear indicators for current/completed/upcoming
3. **Progress Visibility**: Show completed sets and running totals
4. **Error Prevention**: Confirmations for destructive actions

## Technical Architecture

### State Management
- Server Components for initial data loading
- Client Components for interactive features
- Optimistic updates with error boundary rollback
- Persistent timer state across browser refresh

### Database Operations
- RPC functions for complex multi-table operations
- Atomic transactions for data consistency
- Real-time subscriptions for collaborative features (future)
- Efficient queries with proper indexing

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for network issues
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Data recovery for interrupted sessions

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- Workout completion rate > 85%
- Average time to start workout < 30 seconds
- User retention after first workout > 60%
- Feature adoption (weight tracking) > 40%

### Performance
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- State change response < 200ms
- Data persistence success rate > 99.5%
- Timer accuracy deviation < 1 second

### Business
- Daily active users growth
- Average workouts per user per week
- User engagement with progress tracking
- Feature usage analytics

## Acceptance Criteria

Each feature flow must pass all functional requirements and meet non-functional requirements before moving to the next TDD step. Integration tests will validate end-to-end user journeys, and unit tests will ensure individual component reliability.
