**Women**: (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) - (5 × age) - 161

### Activity Multipliers:
- Sedentary: × 1.2
- Lightly Active: × 1.375
- Moderately Active: × 1.55
- Very Active: × 1.725
- Extremely Active: × 1.9

### Goal Adjustments:
- Aggressive Fat Loss: -750 cal
- Moderate Fat Loss: -500 cal
- Slow Fat Loss: -250 cal
- Maintenance: 0 cal
- Lean Bulk: +300 cal
- Bulk: +500 cal

## AI GENERATION PROTOCOL

When generating a program:

### 1. IDENTIFY USER
- Match to closest persona (1-50)
- Consider multiple personas if hybrid

### 2. SELECT DURATION
- 1 month: Quick start, testing
- 2 months: Solid progress
- 3 months: Standard cycle
- 4 months: Full program

### 3. CALCULATE NUTRITION
```
TDEE = BMR × Activity Multiplier
Goal Calories = TDEE ± Goal Adjustment
Protein (g) = Weight (kg) × Protein Factor
Fat (g) = Total Calories × Fat % / 9
Carbs (g) = Remaining Calories / 4
```

### 4. STRUCTURE TRAINING
- Weekly split based on frequency preference
- Exercise selection based on equipment access
- Volume/intensity based on experience level
- Modifications for injuries/limitations

### 5. PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD
- Week-to-week progression plan
- Deload weeks scheduled
- Intensity/volume waves
- Auto-regulation guidelines

### 6. OUTPUT FORMAT
```
Program: [Name based on goal/persona]
Duration: [X weeks]
Frequency: [X workouts/week]

Week 1-X:
  Day 1: [Workout Name]
    - Exercise 1: Sets x Reps @ RPE/% | Rest | Notes
    - Exercise 2: ...

  Daily Nutrition:
    Calories: X
    Protein: Xg | Carbs: Xg | Fat: Xg

    Meal 1 (Time): [Foods] - macros
    Meal 2 (Time): [Foods] - macros
    ...

  Notes: [Weekly focus, deload indicators, etc.]
```
