## 📊 Nutrition Calculation Logic

### The Problem (V2)
❌ Only stored ONE quantity representation
❌ Lossy conversions between servings and grams
❌ User confusion when editing quantities
❌ Inconsistent nutrition calculations

### The Solution (V3)
✅ **Dual quantity storage** - both servings AND grams always tracked
✅ **Bidirectional sync** - edit either field, both update instantly
✅ **Single source of truth** - nutrition ALWAYS from `gramQuantity`
✅ **Zero data loss** - fully reversible conversions

### Example Flow

**User edits servings:**
```typescript
Input: 2.5 slices
→ calculateQuantities(food, 2.5, 'serving')
→ gramQuantity = 2.5 × 28g = 70g
→ Store: {
    servingQuantity: 2.5,
    servingUnit: 'slice',
    gramQuantity: 70,
    lastEditedField: 'serving'
  }
→ calculateNutrition(food, 70g)
→ Display: "2.5 slices (70g)" - 196 cal, 14g protein
```

**User edits grams:**
```typescript
Input: 84g
→ calculateQuantities(food, 84, 'grams')
→ servingQuantity = 84g ÷ 28g = 3 slices
→ Store: {
    servingQuantity: 3,
    servingUnit: 'slice',
    gramQuantity: 84,
    lastEditedField: 'grams'
  }
→ calculateNutrition(food, 84g)
→ Display: "3 slices (84g)" - 235 cal, 16.8g protein
```

**Backend receives:**
```json
{
  "food_id": "uuid-chicken-breast",
  "serving_quantity": 2.5,
  "serving_unit": "breast",
  "gram_quantity": 350,
  "last_edited_field": "serving",
  "calories": 275,
  "protein_g": 51.5,
  "carbs_g": 0,
  "fat_g": 6.1
}
```

## 🎮 User Journey

### First Visit
1. User navigates to `/coach-v3`
2. Server checks auth → redirects to `/login` if needed
3. Authenticated → sees welcome screen with example prompts
4. Bottom nav "Coach" tab links to `/coach-v3`

### Logging a Meal
1. User types: "I ate 2 chicken breasts and 150g of rice for lunch"
2. AI streams response: "I see you had a protein-rich lunch! Let me log that for you..."
3. **Inline meal card appears** below assistant message:
   - Large macro display (calories, protein, carbs, fats)
   - Expandable food items list
   - **Inline editing controls** (NO modal)
   - User can adjust servings OR grams
   - Both quantities update in real-time
   - Nutrition recalculates instantly
4. User clicks "Log This Meal"

2. Clicks "Edit"
3. **Inline controls appear** (no navigation, no modal):
   - Serving input: "2 breasts" with +/- buttons
   - Gram input: "280g" with +/- buttons
   - Edit either field → other updates automatically
   - Nutrition preview updates in real-time
4. User clicks "Done"
5. Changes applied, ready to log

### Conversation History

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Navigate to `/coach-v3` → redirects if not logged in
- [ ] Send text message → streams response
- [ ] Type meal text → inline card appears
- [ ] Edit serving quantity → grams update automatically
- [ ] Edit gram quantity → servings update automatically
- [ ] Click "Log This Meal" → success toast appears
- [ ] Check database → both quantities stored correctly
- [ ] Open sidebar → past conversations load
- [ ] Click conversation → history loads
- [ ] Start new conversation → confirms if current chat exists
- [ ] Test on mobile → responsive layout works
- [ ] Test keyboard shortcuts → Enter sends, Shift+Enter newline
- [ ] Test message reactions → state updates
- [ ] Test copy to clipboard → content copied

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Extremely long message → character limit enforced
- [ ] Network error → error toast shows, graceful fallback
- [ ] Invalid food name → handled by backend
- [ ] Zero quantity → validation prevents
- [ ] Negative quantity → validation prevents
- [ ] Streaming interrupted → error message shows
